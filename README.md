Business Rules:
  - Allow the user to create decks - referencing user in deck
  - Allow the user to add cards to the decks - embedding of cards in the decks
  - Allow the user to create folders
  - Allow the user to add decks to folders - referencing folder in deck - referencing user in folder
  - Allow the user to add decks to a folder or not have decks in a folder

JWT:
  - Utilizing localStorage to store the authorization token (JWT) for now. I understand that it is not the most secure method, however I will fix it later in development.
